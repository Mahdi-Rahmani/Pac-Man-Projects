## Overview
The Pac-Man projects were developed for CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don’t focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

We designed these projects with three goals in mind. The projects allow you to visualize the results of the techniques you implement. They also contain code examples and clear directions, but do not force you to wade through undue amounts of scaffolding. Finally, Pac-Man provides a challenging problem environment that demands creative solutions; real-world AI problems are challenging, and Pac-Man is too.

A more complete description of this course can be found in this [link](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su21/projects/).

## Projects Overview
### P1: Search
We should implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.
The related files and implementation are accessible at this [directory](https://github.com/Mahdi-Rahmani/Pac-Man-Projects/tree/main/Project1_Search)

### P2: Multi-Agent Search
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
The related files and implementation are accessible at this [directory](https://github.com/Mahdi-Rahmani/Pac-Man-Projects/tree/main/Project2_Multi-Agent%20Search)

### P3: Reinforcement Learning
We should implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook’s Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.
The related files and implementation are accessible at this [directory](https://github.com/Mahdi-Rahmani/Pac-Man-Projects/tree/main/Project3_Reinforcement%20Learning)
